## In vitro replicates {#replicates}

Rhod2, CD15, CD38, western blot (myc, nfkb, Bcl2)

## DNA methylation {#dnameth}

Combine DNA methylation on promoter to the tf network analysis

Combine DNA methylation on enhancer using chromatine conformation

## WGBS {#WGBS}

Finish analysing Whole Genome Bisulfite Sequencing

## New k-mers cohort {#cohorts}

Look at our patients cohort with k-mers.

## Starting a paper  {#paper}

* AML
* IDH
* TF activity
* Network analysis
* DNA methylation
* In vitro experiments
* In vivo? experiments/perspectives chrom structure  

## Test other TF activity methods {#tfs}

i-cisTargets

### Aracn {#aracn}

Look at and test Aracn

## Look at other transcriptional datasets even if they are not IDH treatments {#transcri-no-treated}

Same as new k-mers cohort

## Look at enrichment of monocytes granulocytes in the different datasets {#diff-enrichments}

Differentiation may be linked to resistance. Look at diff enrichment and IDHm response. Look at cell lines too.

## Gradient diff patients {#gradient-diff-patients}

Main idea as above.

## DÃ©diff {#dediff}

Investigate on this process.

## Stem cells and RAS pathways {#Ras-stem}

Ras signaling linked to stemness

## Look at other cancer {#other}

NF-kB SMAD3 found in melanoma
