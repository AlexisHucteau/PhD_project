# 6 month plan

## Individual Network part

### Gene regulatory Network

1. Find GRN algorithm
2. Test them
3. Compare results
4. Choose the best one
5. Do TF activity analysis.

### Chromatin structure Network

1. Investigate on the chas depending on cell line
2. Define which cell line pchic network is the best to fit the patients data
3. Maybe cluster patients based on cell line best chas.
4. Add CD34+ pchic network (Make it with chicago algorithm if needed)

### Metabolism Network

1. Run COMPASS (Nathaniel part)
2. t.test on reactions
3. Maybe clustering reaction data
4. Compare to GE clustering
5. Make RECON3D network with igraph
6. Filter for enriched reactions

### PPI Network

1. Find another filtering method or just TF and Gene based on Gene expression and TF activity

### ATAC-seq Network

1. Analyse ATAC-seq data
2. Make pchic of Open chromatin

## Multiplex Network Analysis

1. Talk to Kaustav
2. Make Multiplex Network analysis
