## Els Verhoeyen, GADPH over-expression in the T cell lineage leads to a rare T cell lymphoma through a NF-kB dependant mechanism {#gadph-nfkb}

*RELA is a subunit of NF-KB that is found in our analysis.*

What's important here?
* GADPH induced non canonical NF-kB pathway activation
* inhibition of NF-kB --> increased survival of angioimmunoblastic T cell lymphoma (AITL)
