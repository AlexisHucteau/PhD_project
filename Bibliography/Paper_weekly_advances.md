### Selected paper

[Genome-wide analysis of focal DNA hypermethylation in IDH-mutant AML samples](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.03.433799v2.full)  
[Notes](https://alexishucteau.github.io/PhD_project/Bibliography/Weekly_paper_notes/Genome_wide_analysis_of_focal_DNA_hypermethylation_in_IDH_mutant_AML_samples)

* IDHm hypermethylation occurs in thousands of focal regions compared to CD34+ and other AML subtypes.
* Not really in CGI
* IDH1m has more hypermethylation than IDH2m
* IDH1 & IDH2 hypermeth highly overlap
* IDHm hypermeth enriched in active enhancer
* MYC & ETV6 but expr not changed
* DNMT3 & TET activity may be concentrated in specific genomic regions

[The implications of IDH mutations for cancer development and therapy](https://www-nature-com.proxy.insermbiblio.inist.fr/articles/s41571-021-00521-0)  
[Nodes](https://alexishucteau.github.io/PhD_project/Bibliography/Weekly_paper_notes/The_implications_of_IDH_mutations_for_cancer_development_and_therapy)

* Need heterozygote IDHm/wt
* IDHm -> aberrant histone and DNA methylation, chromatin restructuring, blocking of cellular differentiation and other transformative effects
* Competitive inhibition of TETs
* H2K27me3 changes in glioma
* In hepatoblasts, silencing of HNF4a
* In Pre-adipocytes, downregulation of CEBPa, PPARG, ADIPOQ through H3K27/9me3
* Dysruption of NADPH production
* Dysregulation of GE, DNA repair, inflammation, intracellular trafficking, ageing and cell death
* NAD+ levels is low due to NAPRT1 decreased expression or NAMPT inhibition
* H3K9me3 disrupt DNA damage signalling
* Downregulation of ATM -> impaired DNA damage response
* Increased abundance of unrepaired DNA double-strand breaks link to PARP pathway that need NAD+
* IDHm cells are NAD+ dependant and PARP inhibitor sensitive

[The STAT3-MYC Axis Promotes Survival of Leukemia Stem Cells by Regulating SLC1A5 and Oxidative Phosphorylation](https://www-sciencedirect-com.proxy.insermbiblio.inist.fr/science/article/pii/S0006497121016049?via%3Dihub)  
[Notes](https://alexishucteau.github.io/PhD_project/Bibliography/Weekly_paper_notes/The_STAT3_MYC_Axis_Promotes_Survival_of_Leukemia_Stem_Cells_by_Regulating_SLC1A5_and_Oxidative_Phosphorylation)

* **STAT3** regulates amino acid influx and glutaminolysis in leukemia stem cells by
promoting expression of **MYC** and **SLC1A5**.
Depletion of glutamine and its downstream metabolites leads to a decrease in
OXPHOS activity in LSCs resulting in cell death.
