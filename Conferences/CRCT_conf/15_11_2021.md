# Cellular plasticity and gene expression variability: from drug tolerance to oncogenesis, and back

Jean-Pascal CAPP, INSA / University of Toulouse

## Abstract

Experimental evidence accumulated over the last years on the importance of phenotypic plasticity and epigenetic adaptability in the emergence of drug-tolerance persister cells. Especially, high levels of gene expression variability (noise) and the associated cellular plasticity are involved in the generation of such cells. Moreover, a global increase in cellular stochasticity (entropy) is observed in cancer cells. It suggests that enhanced random gene expression fluctuations are crucial not only for drug tolerance, but also in oncogenesis. Here their possible origin at the tissue level will be considered from the observation that gene expression variability decreases and that single-cell expression profiles homogenize during differentiation. Indeed, the generation of a differentiated state can be seen as a constrained random process: randomness is provided by the stochastic dynamics of biochemical reactions while the environmental constraints, including cell inner structures and cell-cell interactions, drive the system toward a stabilized state of equilibrium. In that case, oncogenesis would be linked to the removal of this microenvironmental control, i.e. to the disruption of the normal cell-cell interactions. This would produce cells with increased gene expression variability, and initiate oncogenesis. Finally, I will discuss the relationships with the aging process, the example of multiple myeloma and therapeutic implications.
