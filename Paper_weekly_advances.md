[Genome-wide analysis of focal DNA hypermethylation in IDH-mutant AML samples](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.03.433799v2.full)  
[Notes .md](https://github.com/AlexisHucteau/PhD_project/blob/main/Weekly_paper_notes/Genome_wide_analysis_of_focal_DNA_hypermethylation_in_IDH_mutant_AML_samples.md)

<details><summary>Notes</summary>

* IDHm hypermethylation occurs in thousands of focal regions compared to CD34+ and other AML subtypes.
* Not really in CGI
* IDH1m has more hypermethylation than IDH2m
* IDH1 & IDH2 hypermeth highly overlap
* IDHm hypermeth enriched in active enhancer
* MYC & ETV6 but expr not changed
* DNMT3 & TET activity may be concentrated in specific genomic regions

[The STAT3-MYC Axis Promotes Survival of Leukemia Stem Cells by Regulating SLC1A5 and Oxidative Phosphorylation](https://www-sciencedirect-com.proxy.insermbiblio.inist.fr/science/article/pii/S0006497121016049?via%3Dihub)

<details><summary>Notes</summary>

* **STAT3** regulates amino acid influx and glutaminolysis in leukemia stem cells by
promoting expression of **MYC** and **SLC1A5**.
Depletion of glutamine and its downstream metabolites leads to a decrease in
OXPHOS activity in LSCs resulting in cell death.
