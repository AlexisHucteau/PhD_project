# Instructions {#instructions}

## Summary {#summary}

* 2 minutes video
* Single page poster
* PDF file
* < 5 MB
* Landscape configuration
* in columnsrather than rows
* Introduction upper left
* Conclusion lower right
* Numbered or bulleted lists

## Online poster {#online-poster}

Online posters are to be prepared as a single page PDF file, which is to be uploaded to the online conference
platform. Please ensure that your PDF file is below 5MB. Your invitation to the platform, will be sent closer to
the event.  
To make best use of the screen size, we strongly recommend that this is prepared in a landscape configuration.
A zoom function is available, to assist in your discussions.  
## Poster Number Allocation {#poster-number-allocation}
Each poster will be allocated a poster number (separate from the abstract number you have been assigned) this
will enable you to locate your poster in the online conference programme and direct other delegates to your
poster, via the online chat function.  
Poster presenters are required to be present in their allocated online poster ‘room’, for the session that their
poster is allocated to. Details of your allocated session will be provided in a separate email.
During this presentation time, up to 14 other attendees can enter your poster room, with the video and
microphone of their device enabled, to discuss your poster.  
Full instructions on uploading your poster and using the system are available in the poster upload information
sheet.  
## POSTER PITCH VIDEO: {#poster-pitch-video}
We encourage presenters to include a short poster pitch video for attendees to view, when you are not presenting
your poster live.  
You will then be required to log back into the abstract submission system at
https://app.oxfordabstracts.com/stages/1925/submitter and upload the link there no later than Friday 17th
September.  
If you have any questions about your poster pitch video please email content-esis2021@elsevier.com
GENERAL GUIDELINES FOR POSTER PRODUCTION  
A poster should be self-contained and self-explanatory, allowing different viewers to proceed on their own while
the author is free to supplement or discuss particular points raised in inquiry. Presentations should be kept simple
and clear. A mixture of text and graphics is recommended. Remember that the viewer, not the author, as in the
case of slide presentations, determines the time spent at each poster.  
Poster Layout  
Arrange materials in columns rather than rows. It is easier for viewers to scan a poster by moving along it, rather
than by zigzagging back and forth in front of it. An introduction should be placed at the upper left and a conclusion
at the lower right. The abstract does not need to be presented, as this is available to attendees beforehand in the
conference app.  
Illustrations  
Figures should be clear, visible graphics, with large type. Each figure or table should have a heading of one or two
lines. Additional essential information should be provided below in a legend. Photographs should have good
contrast, sharp focus and, if necessary, an indication of scale.  
Text  
Minimise narrative. Use large type in short, separated paragraphs. Numbered or bulleted lists are effective ways
to convey a series of points. Do not set entire paragraphs in uppercase or boldface type.  
Titles and Fonts  
Titles and captions should be short and easy to read, preferably in a sans serif font. Use large lettering, allowing
attendees to easily read the information presented. Remember to caption your poster with the abstract title,
authors names and affiliations.

# The poster {#poster}

## Introduction {#introduction}

Acute Myeloid Leukemia is a blood cancer characterized by a blockage in myeloid differentiation and hyperproliferation of transformed myeloid progenitor cells.   
**The mutation in the gene isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) is implicated in Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML), as cells with the alteration abnormally produce an oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG).**

These IDH inhibitors have shown good clinical response in AML patients. However, **primary or acquired resistance to IDH inhibitor therapies represent a major problem limiting their efficacy.**

**In this study, we analysed RNAseq and affymetrix data from different cohorts of AML patient in an IDHm context** [1][Verhaak][TCGA].

## Methods {#methods}

* Datasets
  * RNAseq (IDHi therapy)
  * Affymetrix (Chemotherapy)
* Raw data analysis
  * Differential gene expression
  * Transcription factor activity inference
* Knowledge-based network
  * Protein-protein interaction
  * Transcription factor - target genes
* Network analysis
  * Eigenvalue centrality
