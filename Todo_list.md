## IDH Project

* Analyse DNA methylation from Koichi data with the Focal_disruption_of_DNA_methylation approach
  * Compare Good and Bad responder at Baseline -> DMR_Response
  * Compare Baseline and CD34+ -> DMR IDH
  * Response specific DMR
  * Compare Good and Bad responder at post treatment -> DMR residuel
  * Compare Post and Baseline -> DMR treatment
  * (DMR residuel - DMR traitement) union with Response specific DMR
  * Compare Response specific DMR with IDH specific DMR from Focal_disruption_of_DNA_methylation WGBS.

## Wet lab

* Monday: Subculture
* Wednesday: Subculture
* Friday: Subculture
