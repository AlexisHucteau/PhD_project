# **Genome-wide analysis of focal DNA hypermethylation in IDH-mutant AML samples**

15 AML samples w/ IDH1/2 mutation WGBS  
IDHm vs CD34+ cells  
4000 focal hymermeth  
Hypermeth occurs in CD34 low methylation regions -> DNA meth/demeth active loci  
Enhancer interacting w/ MYC & ETV6  

* IDHm hypermethylation occurs in thousands of focal regions compared to CD34+ and other AML subtypes.
* Not really in CGI
* IDH1m has more hypermethylation than IDH2m
* IDH1 & IDH2 hypermeth highly overlap
* IDHm hypermeth enriched in active enhancer
* MYC & ETV6 but expr not changed
* DNMT3 & TET activity may be concentrated in specific genomic regions
