# The implications of IDH mutations for cancer development and therapy

* Need heterozygote IDHm/wt
* IDHm -> aberrant histone and DNA methylation, chromatin restructuring, blocking of cellular differentiation and other trnasformative effects
* Competitive inhibition of TETs
* H2K27me3 changes in glioma
* In hepatoblasts, silencing of HNF4a
* In Pre-adipocytes, downregulation of CEBPa, PPARG, ADIPOQ through H3K27/9me3
* Dysruption of NADPH production
* Dysregulation of GE, DNA repair, inflammation, intracellular trafficking, ageing and cell death
* NAD+ levels is low due to NAPRT1 decreased expression or NAMPT inhibition
* H3K9me3 disrupt DNA damage signalling
* Downregulation of ATM -> impaired DNA damage response
* Increased abundance of unrepaired DNA double-strand breaks link to PARP pathway that need NAD+
* IDHm cells are NAD+ dependant and PARP inhibitor sensitive
